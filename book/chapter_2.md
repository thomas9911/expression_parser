# Variables

Creating new variables can be done just by using the `=` symbol.

Example:

```js
{{#include ../expression_parser/tests/book_test.rs:chapter_2_assignment}}
```

Currently there is no garbage collection, but if you want you can manually delete variables with:

```js
{{#include ../expression_parser/tests/book_test.rs:chapter_2_unassignment}}
```
